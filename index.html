   <h2 id="about_me">About Me</h2>
   <p>Hello World! Welcome to my page. My name is Rose, and I truly value 
      education. I enjoy learning, finances, reading books,
      and I love people. </p>

   <h2 id="finances">Finances</h2>
   <p>When I turned 18, I researched all about finances and how to
      get my life straight.<br> My parents lived their life one
      way, and I will live it another. I want to be better.<br>
      I learned all I could about credit cards, credit scores,
      and negotiations.<br> I read books about trauma, one's self journey,
      and any book that will serve its purpose and make me a better person.
   </p>
   <p>
      A youtuber I watched to kick off my journey in finance was Graham Stephan. Then, I went
      ahead and joined facebook groups relolving around credit cards and maximizing rewards
      /cashback. Reddit pages such as r/personalfinance is a good place to start learning.
   </p>
   <h2 id="languages">Languages</h2>
   <p>I've taught myself to speak 4 languages and am continuing to learn more as we speak (or as you read).
      <ul>
         <li>English</li>
         <li>Korean or 한국어</li>
         <li>Tagalog</li>
         <li>Kapampangan</li>
      </ul>
      On top of those spoken languages, I have committed myself into learning the languages of
      the computers. Previous to joining Year Up, I've gained some experience
      in coding in these languages:
      <ul>
         <li>Java: 9 years ago, or when I was 11 years old, I created mods for <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/justfamouss-moar-flowers-mod-164-/" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>.</li><br>
         <li>Renpy: 7 years ago, at 13 years old, I've created and taught
            people how to create their own visual novel game. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-R1gWkfa2U" target="_blank">Link to Youtube Video</a>
         </li><br>
         <li>Python: This year, at 20 years old, I've dabbled into Python and learned
            enough to create my own Alien Invasion game, as well as create mini projects
            such as an Overtime Calculator, Weight Converters, and a Magic 8 Ball program.
         </li><br>
         <li>HTML/CSS/Javascript: Now I am currently learning Front End Development.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2 id="music">Music</h2>
      <p>Ocassionally, I enjoy making music. I recently released my song "run" on streaming platforms.</p>
