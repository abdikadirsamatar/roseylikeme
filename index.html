         education. I enjoy learning, finances, reading books,

         <p>When I turned 18, I researched all about finances and how to
            get my life straight. My parents lived their life one
            way, and I will live it another. I want to be better.</p>
         <p>
            I learned all I could about credit cards, credit scores,
            and negotiations. I read books about trauma, one's self journey,
            and any book that will serve its purpose and make me a better person.
         </p>
         <p>
            A youtuber I watched to kick off my journey in finance was Graham Stephan. Then, I went
            ahead and joined facebook groups relolving around credit cards and maximizing rewards
            /cashback. Reddit pages such as r/personalfinance is a good place to start learning.

   <div class="aligner">
      <div class="aligner-item aligner-item--top">
         <p>I've taught myself to speak 4 languages and am continuing to learn more as we speak (or as you read).
            Currently I know:
            <div class="container">
               <button class="raise">English</button>
               <button class="raise">Korean</button>
               <button class="raise">Tagalog</button>
               <button class="raise">Kapampangan</button>
            </div>
            
         On top of those spoken languages, I have committed myself into learning the languages of
         the computers. Prior to joining Year Up, I've gained some experience
         in coding in these languages:
         <h3>Java</h3>
         <p>I created mods for <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/justfamouss-moar-flowers-mod-164-/" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>.</p>
         <h3>Renpy</h3>
         <p>I've created and taught people how to create their own visual novel game. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-R1gWkfa2U" target="_blank">Link to Youtube Video</a></p>
         <h3>Python</h3>
         <p>I've dabbled into Python and learned enough to create my own Alien Invasion game, as well as create mini projects
            such as an Overtime Calculator, Weight Converters, and a Magic 8 Ball program.</p>
         <h3>HTML / CSS / Javascript</h3>
         <p>Now I am currently learning Front End Development.</p>
